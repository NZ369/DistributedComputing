Over this term, we have done a sigificant amout of work surounding the use of satalight and remote sensing data, and how it can be leverages by distributed systems. Our project initially revolved around how to use of satalight imagery from the sentinel 2 mission. The second phase of the project was finding applications for diffient data sources, and how they could be integreated with a veriety of distributed applications. Our group ran into some issues as we were working this term with regard to team composition. There were a siginificant number of students who dropped the course early in the terms, which lead to shifting team composition as the term progressed. As a result, our group was not fully formed until the end of phase 1 of the project when it stabalised and we did not have group members leaving anyomore.

# Project Phase 1

## Platform and Methods Review Document

## Test sites, data, and proposed architecture involving Arbutus and at least one other platform

## Initial results of analysis methods for at least 3 example properties

## Natural Asset monitoring prototype

## Natural Asset monitoring report and notes on future work



# Project Phase 2

## Mosaic Review 

Mosaic is a remarcable up an comming tool that takes advanatage of sentinel satalight imagery. It does theis by combing the satalight images in the best way possible in order to create a high resolution satalight image that can be easily used and queried. This provided an interesitng insight into how proprietyary information can be created, and how that infomration can be used in other tools. Our analysis of mosica incluses a description of how it was to use, as well as some suggestion that might improve it in the future.

## Decentralized and Democratized Modern Platforms 

## Architecture Design and Prototype Implementation for local Drone and/or Sensor data



I haven't bailed on writing. Look, I'm generating a random paragraph at this very moment in an attempt to get my writing back on track. I am making an effort. I will start writing consistently again!

It was a question of which of the two she preferred. On the one hand,**Italics** the choice seemed simple. The more expensive one with a brand name would be the choice of most. It was the easy choice. The safe choice[url title](http://<url>). But she wasn't sure she actually preferred it.

### Any smaller font title

But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a
few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with
[Longe and Parole](http://google.com) and dragged her into their agency, where
they abused her for their projects again and again. And if she hasn’t been
rewritten, then they are still using her.
